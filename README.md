# Oxford IIIT Pets dataset image segmentation
in this project I am analyzing cleaning and visualizing the Oxford IIIT Pets dataset data set then after that I am doing image segmentation on it by the following steps:
1. Data wrangling (Data gathering , Data assessing , Data cleaning).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. Making some conclusions about the data.
4. doing image segmentation to recognize the place of the pets in the images.
